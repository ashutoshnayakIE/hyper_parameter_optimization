# Hyper_parameter_optimization
A tutorial on hyper-parameter example with a toy problem using hyperOpt. It explains what are we doing when we say hyper-paramete optimization. 
We also show an example its implementation in python. After this tutorial, you should be able to implement bayesian optimization procedure along with understanding the theoretical background for it.

## Contents
The different topics we cover in this project are below. The toy example is built along with the theoretical background.
1. What are hyper-parameters
2. What is hyper-paramete optimization
3. Bayesian hyper-parameter optimization
4. Python example of its implementation using hyperopt


## Explaning the data for the toy example
The dataset for the topy example is a simple dataset taken from kaggle (link shown in the next section). The data set contains information such as unit of diversion (userid), time stamp, group of a user (control or treatment), landing page (new or old) and converted (yes/no). Landing page for control group should always be the old page and for the treatment group should be the new page.
